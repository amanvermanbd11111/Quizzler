The Quizzler app is designed for the purpose of increasing awareness about COVID-19 among individuals and organizations. The app features true or false questions, which are designed to test the knowledge of the users about the virus and its impact. The app is primarily intended for individuals who want to brush up on their knowledge, but it can also be used by organizations to assess the awareness of their employees.

This app is an effort to contribute to the fight against the pandemic by increasing awareness and knowledge about the virus. We have many plans for future updates and improvements to the app, including adding more questions and features to keep it updated with the latest information.
